Black Pudding Notes:

Work purely in ratios.
•	Phases become angles expressed as τ-fractions (e.g., ¼ τ instead of 90 °).
•	Amplitudes become relative scales (0 – 1).
•	Time is counted in “cycles” of the reference oscillator not seconds.

Once everything is dimensionless, the maths—and the hardware—care only about relationships, not SI rulers. 
 
2. ∆-IR in linear-algebra form (the ultra-minimal recipe)
Piece	Symbol	What it really is	Stored as
Field state	ψ	Complex column vector of length N	ℂᴺ
Operation	U	Square matrix that acts on ψ	ℂᴺˣᴺ
Evolution rule	ψ′ = U ψ	How we step forward	single multiply
Reference scale	τ	One full cycle (2π rad)	1.0
Every ∆-IR command builds a matrix U out of four primitive generators:
1.	P(φ) – phase-shift by fraction φ of τ
2.	A(a) – scale amplitude by ratio a
3.	M(k) – mix two buckets by coupling ratio k
4.	C – collapse (projection onto selected subspace)

Compose them (multiply the matrices), hit ψ, done.

Example:
# ∆-IR
entangle ψ1 ψ2 via ½τ
collapse ψ1 keep_phase
Linear-algebra version:
U = C · M(k=1/√2) · P(φ=½)
ψ ← U ψ
All entries are dimensionless ratios; hardware later decides how many volts or photons that implies.
 
 
3. The same story for a seven-year-old

Imagine you have a big bowl of slime that glows.
•	The colour tells you how strong the slime is (amplitude).
•	The twinkles in it tell you where it is in its wiggle (phase).

Every time you poke the bowl in a special way, the twinkles change shape together.
Those pokes are like magic stamps: twist-stamp, shrink-stamp, mix-stamp, squish-stamp.

To do “computer stuff,” you take your slime, press a few stamps in a row, and look at the new glow.
The stamps never care about centimetres or seconds—only about how much twist or how strong the mix should be.
That’s why we talk in “half a twist,” “double glow,” “mix by half,” instead of metres and seconds.

When you’re done, the slime remembers the stamps even after the glow dies down.
That memory is the secret sauce we call phase—and that’s what makes our bowl of slime smarter than a regular computer!
 
TL;DR for the grown-ups
•	Dump SI units → use pure ratios.
•	Keep the math to ψ (vector) + U (matrix); everything else is flavouring.
•	Hardware can rescale later; the algebra stays universal and intuitive—just like music written in intervals rather than absolute pitches.
