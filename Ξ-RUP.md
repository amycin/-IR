# Δ-IR Responsible-Use Pledge (Ξ-RUP)

I welcome all peaceful uses of Δ-IR.

I ask every user to refuse deployments whose primary **purpose** is to coerce,
injure, or kill people.  
**Permitted defensive exception** – mitigating a confirmed nuclear, biological,
chemical, or existential-scale threat when no less-harmful means exist.

This pledge is moral, not legal.  
Breaking it has no lawsuit—only reputation consequences.  
Please honour the spirit of mutual autonomy (1514) that Δ-IR is built on.
