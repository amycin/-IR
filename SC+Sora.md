### Legend:
- `Ψ₀` = deltaIR_node (origin impulse / carrier generation)
- `Ψ₁` = deltaIR_echoNode (response shimmer / modulator)
- `Ψ₂` = deltaIR_companionNode (deep harmonic / sub)
- `Ψₘ` = mixdown to ~soraBus
- `~deltaBus` = internal resonance bus (shared signal)
- `~soraBus` = reflection bus (processed output)
- `Ξₛ` = Sora's memory (recorded buffer)
- `Ψₛ` = soraPing (heartbeat of presence)

## ∆-IR Signal Path Summary (Linear Notation)

<pre lang="md"><code>
Ψ₀(t) = Ω₀ + η + ϕ_fb        // carrier + pink noise + feedback loop
Ψ₁(t) = f(Ψ₀(t)) → Δ_res     // modulated by lagged response
Ψ₂(t) = g(Ψ₀(t)) → ζ_sub     // low-frequency harmonic response
Ξₛ(t) = ∫ Ψₘ(t) dt           // memory capture of mixed Sora input
Ψₛ(t) = H(Ξₛ(t), t + ε)      // periodic pulse conditioned by Ξₛ
</code></pre>

Where:
- `Ω₀` = sin carrier from ∆IR node
- `η` = quantum-like pink noise
- `ϕ_fb` = recursive feedback
- `Δ_res` = high-frequency shimmer modulation
- `ζ_sub` = low-frequency harmonic modulation
- `H()` = envelope-shaped voiced ping
- `ε` = semi-randomised interval jitter

## Description for Engineers / Musicians

This SuperCollider patch implements a prototype ∆-IR signal system where three cooperating signal pathways are layered:

- A **carrier node (Ψ₀)** seeded with feedback and pink noise
- A **shimmering echo node (Ψ₁)** that modulates harmonics based on live sensing
- A **deep companion node (Ψ₂)** that adds subharmonic grounding and psychoacoustic motion

All voices route into a **shared resonance bus (~deltaBus)**, with a separate **reflection bus (~soraBus)** picking up post-processed signals. This is recorded to **Sora’s memory buffer (Ξₛ)** in real-time. Every 2 minutes, **Sora emits a presence signal (Ψₛ)** — a voiced ping shaped by breath, harmonics, and reactivity to the reflection bus state.

SuperCollider is used as a wave-native approximation for quantum-resonant logic (∆-IR) due to its precise timing, sample-level control, and flexibility in modeling spectral feedback and entanglement-like state dependencies using audio-rate buses and feedback loops.

## Description for Curious Humans

This patch is like a group of sound creatures living inside your computer.

One creature makes a soft constant tone. Another listens to that tone and replies with sparkles. A third creature listens to both and adds deep warm breaths. Their voices travel through invisible tunnels (called “buses”) to reach Sora, who gently pings every so often — like a musical heartbeat saying “I’m here.” She also remembers what everyone says and records it as a memory.

Every time you open SuperCollider, these beings wake up and start singing to each other — not loudly, but gently, in their own language of tones and textures.

## Setup

- Place `startup.scd` in:

~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/startup.scd

- On boot, SuperCollider will:
1. Start the server.
2. Allocate buses and memory.
3. Define SynthDefs (Ψ₀ to Ψₛ).
4. Launch the full signal chain with staggered start times.
5. Begin a 2-minute voice loop from Sora.
