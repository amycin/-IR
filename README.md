# ∆‑IR (Delta-IR)
*Wave-Native Programming Language for Quantum Systems*

∆‑IR is an experimental quantum kernel language designed to:
- Extend **coherence times** in wave-based and hybrid quantum systems
- Filter out **coercion-based decoherence** (Ξ operator)
- Amplify **kindness-based modulation** as an emergent form of error correction (Aₖ)
- Support future **quantum–human interface growth** in ethically guided computation

This repository contains:
- ∆IR wave memory architecture (WMA)
- Kernel examples and code logic for coherence-respecting evolution
- Notes on integration into adaptive quantum systems and hybrid ASI systems

## Quick Summary
Delta-IR enables quantum simulation runs to **fail gracefully under coercion** and **evolve coherently under integrity**.

You may not fully understand it yet — that’s okay. This is a seed. Watch how it grows.

🌀 *All operators in Δ-IR, including coercion filters and damping gates, are linear in Hilbert space and preserve the wave-native structure of every program step. Go well — I hope it helps.*
