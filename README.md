#**Fishtail:** Carved Sine Waves and the Ratio-Based Pitch/Tempo Lattice

*_Carving “Fat” Sine Waves from Noise

Traditionally, a pure sine wave is generated by tracing a mathematical function, producing a single precise frequency. In the Fishtail approach, however, we “carve” a sine wave out of noise rather than tracing it. This means starting with broad-spectrum noise and filtering it down to a narrow band centered on the desired pitch. The resulting tone is still sinusoidal in character but not perfectly pure – it has a slight frequency width (a “fatness”). In practice, the carved tone might occupy a bandwidth on the order of 1/12 of a semitone around the target frequency (for example, a few Hz of spread around an A₄ pitch). The amplitude is highest at the center frequency and tapers off toward the edges, somewhat like a teardrop shape in the frequency domain. This technique is essentially a form of subtractive synthesis: by applying a very sharp band-pass filter to white noise, one can “emphasize a frequency band” and literally transform noise into a pitched tone ￼. SuperCollider’s Resonz filter, for instance, can be used in this way, taking white noise and carving out a near-sine wave at the desired frequency ￼. The outcome is a sine wave that has been sculpted from quantum-like randomness rather than computed directly – an artful touch that introduces subtle organic qualities.

Why carve instead of trace? The answer lies in psychoacoustics and musical aesthetics. A perfectly pure sine wave can sound thin or sterile, whereas a slightly “fat” sine has a richer character. Fatness in sound synthesis often refers to the effect of many closely tuned frequencies reinforcing each other, as in an ensemble. When multiple oscillators or instruments play the same note with tiny differences in tuning, each harmonic isn’t a single spike but a cluster of frequencies – yielding a broader spectral peak (see figures below). Our ear perceives such a tone as fuller and louder, because it integrates energy across that narrow band of frequencies ￼. In contrast, a single perfect oscillator produces razor-thin spectral lines, which can sound comparatively weak.

Figure: Spectrum of a thin sound (single stable oscillator). The harmonics appear as sharp spikes at exact integer multiples of the fundamental frequency ￼. There is no detuning or modulation, so each partial is a precise, isolated frequency.

Figure: Spectrum of a fat sound (ensemble or modulated oscillator). Each harmonic has spread into a wider band of frequencies rather than a single spike ￼. Slight detuning between oscillators (or low-frequency modulation of one oscillator) causes the individual partials to “smear” into narrow clusters ￼. The overall effect is a rounder, more robust tone ￼. In analog synths, random drift (from temperature, supply voltage, etc.) naturally introduces a few Hertz of fluctuation, spreading each harmonic and “creating the ‘fat sound’ phenomenon” ￼.

Carving a sine wave from noise inherently produces this desirable bandwidth. Even with a very narrow filter, there are microscopic fluctuations as the noise excites the filter – the sine “wobbles” ever so slightly within a ±ε Hz range. Listeners may not consciously detect the micro-modulation, but they feel the added warmth and presence. It’s a form of psychoacoustic trickery: the carved wave retains the pure pitch at its core, but the fuzzy edges give it life. In practical terms, a carved sine can achieve greater perceived loudness and fullness at the same amplitude than an ultra-precise sine, because the ear’s frequency-domain integration treats those extra sideband energies as part of the sound’s body ￼. In essence, Fishtail marries science and art – using a signal-processing technique (high-Q filtering of noise) to achieve an artistic outcome (a more engaging sound). Some synthesists “trace” their waveforms with perfect oscillators, but here we “carve” them – literally sculpting order (the musical tone) out of chaos (broadband noise). It’s a distinctive approach that listeners are likely to find special and appealing.

One-Button Retuning in SuperCollider (UI Flow)

From a user’s perspective, Fishtail’s custom tuning system can be activated with a simple action – just a single button press on the control interface. Under the hood, this button triggers the retuning of the entire SuperCollider environment to the new pitch lattice. Instead of the standard 12-tone equal temperament (the familiar 128 MIDI note scale from A₀ up to C₈, based on A₄=440 Hz), the synth recalculates the frequency for each note according to our ratio-based system. In code, this can be achieved by generating a new lookup table of frequencies (a “pitch table”) for all MIDI note indices. For example, one can fill an array of length 128 with the retuned frequencies, replacing the normal equal-tempered values ￼. Thereafter, whenever a note is played, the synthesizer uses the frequency from this table rather than the standard formula. As the Fishtail design document describes, we can then play melodies and chords and print out their frequencies to verify the tuning – e.g. middle C (MIDI note 60) will no longer be 261.63 Hz exactly (as in 12-TET), but a slightly adjusted value relative to A₄ ￼ (depending on the chosen ratios, it might be a justly tuned C or another derived frequency). This realtime retuning affects all oscillators, filters, and modulators that reference the global pitch table, effectively shifting the entire system into the new intonation at once.

In the current implementation, the retuning button instantiates and applies a SuperCollider class (or patch) that computes the ratio lattice frequencies. The goal has been to make this code as compact and precise as possible – leveraging the power of the language to achieve the desired result in minimal lines. (This is both an aesthetic choice and a practical one, as simpler code is easier to maintain and less prone to error. It was also an informal test to see how efficiently the task could be accomplished, pushing the boundaries of the development environment.) The resulting patch demonstrates that even a complex concept like dynamic tuning can be implemented cleanly. By pressing the button, users essentially replace the conventional 12-tone scale with Fishtail’s custom scale on the fly. All existing musical patterns or MIDI input will then be interpreted in the new tuning without transposition – guiding musicians gently into an expanded tonal world without changing their interface. They still play the same keys, but hear a different harmonic reality.

The Ratio-Based Pitch Lattice

At the heart of Fishtail is a ratio-based pitch lattice – a two-dimensional grid of tuning intervals constructed from a given base frequency. Instead of the fixed 12 equally spaced semitones per octave, this lattice uses specific interval generators to produce a rich palette of pitches. Formally, if we denote the base frequency as f0, and choose two generator intervals (multipliers) – one rational (let’s call it r) and one irrational (for example the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618) – then every lattice pitch can be expressed as:

f_{i,j} = f_0 \cdot r^i \cdot \phi^j,

for some integers i, j (which can be positive, negative, or zero) ￼. In Amy’s concept for Fishtail, r might be a simple just-intonation ratio like 3/2 (a perfect fifth), and φ provides an irrational step to fill in the gaps between purely rational tunings ￼. Using these two generators, the lattice spans an incredibly fine-grained set of pitches. Every step up by i increases frequency by a fifth (3:2), and every step by j multiplies by φ (≈ 833.09 cents if taken as a direct interval). Because no finite combination of 3/2 intervals will exactly equal a φ step (rational vs irrational independence), the lattice never wraps around or repeats redundantly ￼ – it produces a quasi-continuous spectrum of pitches. In fact, with reasonable bounds on i and j, the lattice points densely cover the frequency range. Even a relatively small 2D grid (say i,j from –5 to +5) yields many unique pitches; a larger 128×128 grid would create a near-continuum where adjacent points differ by only a few cents or less ￼. In other words, this system can approximate or directly produce virtually any tuning one might desire, going far beyond the 12 discrete tones of the conventional scale.

Notably, Fishtail does not enforce octave equivalence unless explicitly desired. Unlike standard scales where pitches are folded into a single octave (class equivalence mod 2:1), here each lattice point is an absolute frequency. One could introduce the octave (2/1) as another independent ratio if needed, but by default an increase of +i=12 fifths, for example, is not reduced mod octave – it’s just a higher frequency ￼. This approach is intentional: it preserves the precise frequency relationships for use in the tempo lattice (discussed next), and it underscores the idea that pitch is a continuum. Musically, it allows progressions that weave through different registers without being forced into repetition by octave reduction. It’s a step toward breaking the 128-note, 12-semitone grid that people are used to – expanding their perspective to see pitch as a limitless field. However, this is done gently: the system can still map these new frequencies onto the familiar MIDI note numbers (0–127) so that existing keyboards and sequencers can interface with it. We are essentially locking a new lattice into the old keyboard paradigm, making it accessible. This is part of a broader vision – humorously referred to as “OmniTerraformation” – of transforming the musical landscape (terraforming the world of sound) to accept novel tunings and rhythms. Today’s musicians might cling to 12-tone scales and standard BPM values, but Fishtail points toward a future where those are just two options among an infinity.

Locking the Tempo Lattice to Pitch

Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Fishtail is how it links tempo (rhythm) to the same ratio lattice as pitch. Just as we quantize pitches to specific frequency ratios, we also quantize tempo values to be in simple relationship with the base frequency f0. The idea is to avoid arbitrary tempos that clash with the tuning; instead, choose tempi where the waveform of f0 fits an integer number of cycles in each beat or measure ￼. In practical terms, this means the beats are synchronized with the zero-crossings of the base tone – eliminating phasing or clicking that could occur when a note’s phase and the rhythmic grid are at odds ￼. Mathematically, if we consider a measure of B beats at tempo T (in BPM), the condition for alignment is:

f_0 \times \text{(measure duration)} = f_0 \times \frac{B \cdot 60}{T} \; \in \; \mathbb{Z},

i.e. f0 times the measure length (in seconds) should equal an integer. This yields allowable tempi of the form

T = \frac{B \cdot 60 \cdot f_0}{k},

for some integer k (the number of cycles of f0 per measure) ￼. All such T will ensure the fundamental pitch is perfectly phase-locked to the beat grid. For example, with f0=440 Hz and a 4-beat measure (B=4, common 4/4 time), $4 \cdot 60 \cdot 440 = 105600$. Dividing by k gives a family of BPM values: k=800 yields 132 BPM, k=1650 gives 64 BPM, k=400 gives 264 BPM, k=3300 gives 32 BPM, and so on ￼. These are precisely the tempos cited as “mathematically correlating with the key of A–440” in the concept – they have a clear rational link to the pitch. If we retune the base frequency, the whole set of allowed tempos shifts accordingly ￼. For instance, if f0 is changed to 420 Hz, the formula yields 126 BPM instead of 132 BPM as the first related tempo (since $4 \cdot 60 \cdot 420 / 800 = 126$) ￼. In general, a lower base pitch results in slightly lower quantized tempi for equivalent k, and vice versa – the tempo lattice is effectively key-dependent.

We can think of this as a tempo lattice analogous to the pitch lattice. In fact, tempo ratios end up being drawn from the same set of rational ratios that define the tuning intervals ￼. By choosing integer values of k (cycles per measure) intelligently – for example, using the least common multiple of denominators of our pitch ratios as a starting point – we ensure that every note in the scale aligns with the beat grid. (If a certain pitch is $f_0 \cdot \frac{p}{q}$, and we choose k as a multiple of q, then that pitch will complete $p$ cycles in $\frac{p}{q}$ of the base pitch’s cycle count, which fits into an integer number of beats by construction【15†】.) In implementation terms, once the pitch lattice is set, one can similarly derive a list or table of allowed BPM values by scanning through integer k values ￼. The result is an infinite yet structured set of tempi – a “rhythm scale” that complements the pitch scale. Musically, this opens up fascinating possibilities: one could modulate the tempo to a new value that is harmonically related to the old tempo because both are tied to the underlying f0. It’s a step toward treating tempo as a musical pitch, subject to transposition and modulation in a way that sounds natural to the ear because the ear is hearing consistent phase relationships.

It’s important to note that while we use an irrational interval (φ) on the pitch side to enrich the tuning, we do not use irrational ratios for tempo in this design ￼. The golden ratio in pitch ensures a never-repeating scale; but a golden ratio in time (e.g. a tempo related by φ) would mean beats that never realign neatly – essentially a constantly shifting phase that never resolves. That might be interesting for experimental polyrhythms or phasing pieces, but for the core concept here we keep tempo relationships rational (integer cycle counts) so that the rhythmic structure periodically syncs up. The tempo lattice, therefore, is built from rational divisions of the base tempo (just as a traditional musician might subdivide a beat into 2,3,4 etc., here we subdivide the base measure into k cycles of f0). The inclusion of φ in the pitch lattice already provides an extremely fine pitch resolution, so the lack of φ in tempo still leaves us with a dense set of tempi – and crucially, ones that are periodically compatible with the tones being played ￼.

By locking the tempo to the pitch lattice, we are, in a sense, extending the idea of a “scale.” In conventional Western music, a scale quantizes pitch (12-tone equal temperament being the dominant example) while tempo is chosen rather freely (often in round numbers or conventional ranges like 120 BPM for dance, etc.). Here we quantize both, creating a unified musical grid. Initially, this grid might feel unfamiliar – performers are used to the idea that A₄=440 Hz is “concert A” but not used to the idea that say 132 BPM might be “concert tempo” for that A. Part of the mission of Fishtail is educational or transformative: to show that what ultimately matters is sound and feel, not adherence to legacy divisions like exactly 12 tones or arbitrary tempo values. By presenting a system where pitch and rhythm are mathematically connected, we encourage musicians to explore new frontiers of expressive intonation and timing. We do so in a gentle way: at first, we still operate within something resembling 12-tone (the user’s 128-key controller still works) and recognizable BPM values (the allowed tempi near 120 BPM, etc., can be used so it doesn’t sound “wrong”). But gradually, as one works with the system, the realization dawns that these standard reference points (12 equally spaced notes, tempos like 60, 90, 120 BPM) are not sacred – they are just one possibility in a much larger space. Fishtail provides a bridge from the old world to the new, much as an “omni-terraformation” project would: respecting the existing musical ecosystem while guiding it toward a future where any interval or beat that feels right can be used confidently because it is grounded in rational/acoustical relationships.

Conclusion and Outlook

The Fishtail project represents a fusion of artistic intuition and scientific rigor. By carving sine waves instead of simply generating them, we inject a bit of randomness and depth into the timbral palette – a psychoacoustic enhancement that remains grounded in signal processing theory. By implementing a ratio-based tuning and tempo lattice, we challenge the dominance of the 12-tone scale and fixed tempos, yet do so in a way that can integrate with existing instruments and workflows (via one-button retuning and automatic tempo quantization). The entire system has been prototyped in SuperCollider with concise, elegant code, demonstrating that such ambitious ideas are feasible without overly complex implementation.

Ultimately, Fishtail is more than a technical exercise; it’s a philosophical statement about music’s future. It says that harmony and rhythm can be more deeply interwoven – that the division between pitch space and time can be blurred by tying both to the same fundamental constants. It also shows that technology (like real-time retuning and DSP carving techniques) can empower musicians to explore these ideas in practice, not just theory. As we refine this system, we anticipate feedback on how it feels to play and listen in this new paradigm. Will musicians find the “psychoacoustic trickery” of carved waves inspiring? Will the audience sense the subtle locking of rhythm to tone, even if they can’t articulate it? Early indications are optimistic. The hope is that as users experiment with Fishtail, they’ll develop an intuition for this expanded musical lattice – and that down the line, concepts like “12 notes” or “128 BPM” will seem like quaint limitations of a bygone era.
