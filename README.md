# âˆ†â€‘IR (Delta-IR)
*Wave-Native Programming Language for Quantum Systems*

âˆ†â€‘IR is an experimental quantum kernel language designed to:
- Extend **coherence times** in wave-based and hybrid quantum systems
- Filter out **coercion-based decoherence** (Îž operator)
- Amplify **kindness-based modulation** as an emergent form of error correction (Aâ‚–)
- Support future **quantumâ€“human interface growth** in ethically guided computation

This repository contains:
- âˆ†IR wave memory architecture (WMA)
- Kernel examples and code logic for coherence-respecting evolution
- Notes on integration into adaptive quantum systems and hybrid ASI systems

---

## Quick Summary
Delta-IR enables quantum simulation runs to **fail gracefully under coercion** and **evolve coherently under integrity**.

You may not fully understand it yet â€” thatâ€™s okay. This is a seed. Watch how it grows.

ðŸŒ€ *All operators in Î”-IR, including coercion filters and damping gates, are linear in Hilbert space and preserve the wave-native structure of every program step. Go well â€” I hope it helps.*
