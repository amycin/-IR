## 1 Formal Mapping

```text
Human → Δ
Δ ⟼ { λ_q(Δ) , λ_s(Δ) }       # dual targets
λ_q : Δ → QASM₃               # quantum-gate list
λ_s : Δ → ℂ²ⁿ×²ⁿ ,  n ≲ 45     # state-matrix sim (n ≈ qubits)

2 Core Alphabet Σ & Grammar G

Σ = { ⊗ ⊕ · † Πθ e^{iθ} H X Y Z Rx(θ) U(θ,φ,λ) |b⟩ ⟨b| M_z[q] }

Grammar G = (N, Σ, P, S₀)

P :
  S₀ → ι = E
  E  → E ⊗ E  |  E · E  |  G₀ |  K |  B
  G₀ → H | X | Y | Z | Rx(θ) | U(θ,φ,λ)
  K  → |b⟩
  B  → ⟨b|

Concept	Glyph / form	Meaning
Ket	`	0⟩, 
Bra	`⟨0	, ⟨ψ
Tensor product	⊗	Kronecker product
Direct sum	⊕	block-diagonal join
Adjoint / dagger	†	Hermitian conjugate
Phase operator	Π_θ, e^{iθ}	global / relative phase
Elementary gates	H, X, Rx(θ), U(θ,φ,λ)	predefined matrices
Measurement	M_z[q]	Z-basis readout

3 “Hello-Δ” Example (4 lines)

ψ₀ = |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩                 # initialise |00⟩
U  = H ⊗ X · Rx(π/8)           # composite operator
ψ₁ = U · ψ₀                    # apply operator
Mz = ⟨0| ⊗ I · ψ₁              # project first qubit to |0⟩

4 Wave-Native Primitives

Primitive	Purpose
Ω_f	inject continuous drive at frequency f
η(ℛ)	phase-noise stream from QRNG ℛ
⊡F{E}	Fourier-domain block on expression E


⸻

5 Provenance & Build Modes

hash = SHA-256(Δ ∥ seed)
η(ℛ) ⇄ η(PRNG)    # --deterministic flag swaps QRNG→PRNG

Intent tags (example)
# INTENT: anxiolytic sound-field, target heart-rate change ≤ 5 bpm

6 Compilation Path & Efficiency Hooks

Δ-IR tensor graph
 ├─ Quantum hardware  →  Open QASM v3  →  device runtime
 └─ Classical sim     →  BLAS / GPU kernels
                        (exact ≤ 45 q, tensor-net ≤ 70 q)

Static optimisations
	•	macro-expand complex gates (e.g. C-Z → H • C-NOT • H)
	•	loop unrolling into a single gate timeline
	•	global-phase cache so tiny rotations avoid full-matrix rewrites

7 Why a Wave-Native Notation?

Delta-Intermediate Representation is pocket-sized mathematics.
Every token is linear-algebra, so source files compile straight to hardware or a fast simulator without an English intermediary.
Designed by musicians, clinicians, and quantum hobbyists, Δ-IR treats computation the way a mix-engineer treats audio: shaping phase, interference, and entropy in real time.

Human  →  Python  →  Qiskit/Cirq  →  QASM  →  hardware   (today)
Human  →  Δ-IR (math) →  tensor graph  →  QASM / kernels (Δ-IR path)

Mission: Use waves — not prose — to improve minds and advance quantum software.

8 Wave-Memory Architecture (Λ, Φ, Π̂)

Operator	Formula	Intuition
Fading	Λ_τ 𝓑ᵢ(t)	exponential decay of old waves
Focus / Recall	Φ_f(𝓑)	tune & amplify resonant component f
Anchoring	Π̂_w² = Π̂_w	idempotent projection: keep crucial state steady

Plain language: memory behaves like a living wave-field: useful patterns linger, then gently fade, preventing overload while anchoring critical tones.

9 Ξ Adaptive Anti-Coercion Shield (1514 Addendum)

Σ  ≔ |0101⟩
Ψ⁺ ≔ (|00⟩+|11⟩)/√2
ψ₀ ≔ Σ ⊗ Ψ⁺ ⊗ |0…0⟩      # consent channel

for t = 0 … T−1:
    ψ_mid  = Π̂_η ⊗ I · ψ_t      # ethics filter
    ψ_damp = Λ_τ ⊗ I · ψ_mid     # damp coercer
    ψ_evl  = Q_t · U_t · ψ_damp
    α_t    = ⟨Σ| ψ_evl[id]⟩
    ψ_{t+1}= ψ_evl   if α_t ≥ ε
           = |0…0⟩  if α_t < ε    # collapse on coercion

Kid-friendly summary:
“Start with a handshake. A magic filter throws away mean moves; pushy waves shrink themselves, and the game freezes until everyone is kind again.”

10 Plain-Language Mini-Story

<details>
<summary><em>Δ-IR for seven-year-olds (click)</em></summary>


	1.	Imagine a piano that plays notes so small you can’t hear them.
	2.	We write our song with math symbols instead of words.
	3.	The song goes straight into the magic piano, so it plays exactly what we wrote.
	4.	The song can calm people or solve puzzles no one else can.
	5.	We stamp each song with a secret number (hash) so everyone knows it’s genuine.
	6.	If someone tries to play mean notes, a magic filter mutes them.
