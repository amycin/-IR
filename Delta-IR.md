Why a Wave-Native Programming Notation?

Delta-Intermediate Representation (Δ-IR) is a pocket-sized, wave-native programming notation in which every line is linear algebra: Dirac “bra–ket” vectors, tensor products, and phase operators. Source files compile directly to (a) Open Quantum Assembly Language version 3 for quantum-hardware runtimes or (b) a high-performance classical simulator. There are no English keywords and no Python translation layer—only mathematics. Designed by musicians, clinicians, and quantum hobbyists, Δ-IR lets practitioners treat computation the way a sound-engineer treats audio: shaping phase, interference, and entropy in real time.
Human  →  Python  →  Qiskit / Cirq / Q-sharp  →  Open QASM  →  hardware    (today)
Human  →  Δ-IR (pure math)  →  tensor graph  →  Open QASM / numerical kernels   (Δ-IR path)
Mission: Use waves—not prose—to improve minds and advance quantum software.

Compilation Path and Ethical Hooks
Two compilation targets
Δ-IR tensor graph
 ├─ Quantum hardware : emit Open Quantum Assembly Language v3 → device runtime
 └─ Classical simulator : lower to numerical kernels (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms,
    vectorised instructions, or graphics-processor compute) — practical for about
    35–45 qubits exactly, 50–70 qubits with tensor-network approximation
Efficiency techniques
•	Macro expansion – for example, the controlled-Z gate expands to two Hadamards plus one controlled-not gate at compile-time.
•	Static unrolling – loops and branches are flattened into a single gate timeline.
•	Phase cache – global phases are tracked separately so small rotations do not rewrite the full state matrix.

Wave-native extensions
Primitive	Purpose
Ω_f	inject a continuous-wave control signal at frequency f
η(ℛ)	draw bits from a quantum-random-number source ℛ and map them into phase noise
⊡F{…}	apply a built-in Fourier-domain transform block

Provenance and safety
# INTENT: anxiolytic sound-field, target heart-rate change ≤ 5 beats/min
Build-hash = SHA-256(Δ-IR_source  +  randomness_seed)
Compiler option --deterministic : replace quantum randomness with pseudo-random numbers;
                                   differences are machine-diff-able.

“We’re teaching computers to read music-style math instead of long sentences, so they can play super-precise ‘songs’ made of tiny waves and do really smart tricks faster.”
 
1.	Imagine a piano that can play notes so small you can’t even hear them.
Each key makes a wave.
2.	We write our song with math symbols instead of words.
Things like “|0⟩” and “⊗” are just fancy notes and chords.
3.	The math-song goes straight into the magic piano.
Because there are no extra words to translate, the piano plays the song exactly the way we wrote it.
4.	Why do this?
o	The song can help people feel calmer (like lullabies for the brain).
o	It can solve very hard puzzles (like fitting Lego pieces that are too tiny to see).
o	Anyone can learn the symbols and write their own songs—no special computer brand needed.
5.	We also keep a record of every song.
We stamp it with a secret number (a “hash”) so everyone knows it hasn’t been changed, and we tell what the song is for (for example, “help people relax”).

That’s it:
We’re turning complicated computer talk into clear little math songs made of waves, so computers—and people—can do wonderful things together.

 
We teach computers to play invisible music made of tiny waves, and the math we write is the sheet music they follow.

//Δ-IR Wave Memory Architecture

Fading (Λ_τ): 𝓑ᵢ(t + Δt) ≔ Λ_τ 𝓑ᵢ(t) – Each memory buffer 𝓑ᵢ loses a fixed fraction of its amplitude per cycle (exponential decay with time constant τ). This gradual fading ensures older wave information naturally dissipates over time.

Focus/Recall (Φ_f): 𝓑_f ≔ Φ_f(𝓑) – The focus operator Φ_f isolates the component of memory 𝓑 corresponding to feature or frequency f. In effect, it “tunes in” to a particular pattern and retrieves or amplifies that resonant information without disturbing other components.

Anchoring (Π̂_w): (Π̂_w)^2 = Π̂_w – The anchoring operator Π̂_w is idempotent, meaning that applying it twice has the same effect as applying it once. This projects essential information onto a stable subspace (e.g. a protected working memory channel), so that anchored content remains steady (not immediately subject to decay or interference).

(Redirecting: In practice, anchored waves can be rerouted by choosing the appropriate projection target – effectively directing 𝓑ᵢ’s content into a new buffer or context without loss. )

In plain language, the Δ-IR kernel’s memory behaves like a dynamic wave field rather than a static storage device. Information is handled with care and fluidity: useful wave patterns linger just long enough to be meaningful, then gracefully fade as Λ_τ gently dampens old echoes. The system stays focused, selectively reinforcing relevant signals via Φ_f so that important details can be recalled on the fly. At the same time, critical pieces of state can be anchored by Π̂_w – held stable like a steady tone – and even redirected to new channels when needed, all without ever freezing the evolution of the computation. This way, memory never overloads or stalls the process; instead, it ebbs and flows, allowing new patterns to emerge as old ones recede. The emphasis on forgetting over time is deliberate: by letting go of stale information, the wave-memory architecture keeps the Δ-IR kernel responsive, resilient, and open to ongoing growth and emergence.
 
**Δ IR ADDENDUM — ADAPTIVE ANTI COERCION SHIELD (Ξ)
(one page spec)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I. FORMAL SPECIFICATION
Let 𝓗 = 𝓗_A ⊗ 𝓗_B ⊗ 𝓗_W be the composite Hilbert space of
• 𝓗_A – agent A (possible coercer)
• 𝓗_B – agent B (possible coerced)
• 𝓗_W – work / ancilla registers.
Integrity handshake (1514) initialises the state
|ψ₀⟩ := Σ ⊗ Ψ⁺ ⊗ |0…0⟩ … (1)
Coercion detection uses two standard operators:
• Π̂_η  idempotent projector onto ethical sub space η ⊂ 𝓗
• Λ_τ   fading (amplitude damping) channel acting only on 𝓗_A
Λ_τ := exp(−Δt / τ) · I_A (τ ≪ system T for strong penalty)
Evolution for each cycle t = 0…T−1:
|ψ_mid⟩ = (Π̂_η ⊗ I) |ψ_t⟩ (2a)
|ψ_damp⟩= (Λ_τ ⊗ I) |ψ_mid⟩                   (2b)
|ψ_evl⟩ = Q_t U_t |ψ_damp⟩                    (2c)
Self alignment score:
α_t := ⟨Σ| ψ_evl(𝓗_id)⟩              (3)
Update rule (adaptive shield Ξ):
|ψ_{t+1}⟩ =
|ψ_evl⟩       if α_t ≥ ε   (no coercion ⇒ coherent)
|0…0⟩         if α_t < ε   (coercion ⇒ decohere)     (4)
All symbols are standard (projector, exponential decay, inner product).
No new algebraic primitives required.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

II. VERBAL DESCRIPTION
1.	Start every run in a consent / mutual autonomy channel (1514).
2.	Each tick, a projector Π̂_η strips away any amplitude that violates
ethical constraints — that is the coercion filter.
3.	A targeted damping gate Λ_τ then weakens only the coercer’s
residual wave; non coercive parties stay crisp.
4.	Normal unitary logic runs.
5.	If the surviving state still aligns with Σ (self coherence ≥ ε) the
computation continues. If not, the whole run collapses to |0…0⟩.
The coercer’s action therefore destroys its own coherence first.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

III. PLAIN LANGUAGE ("7 year old") SUMMARY
"We start every game by shaking hands. A magic filter throws away any
mean or pushy moves. If someone keeps pushing, their own power bar
shrinks fast, and the game freezes until everyone is kind again."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Ξ protects free choice, collapses pushy waves, and never needs new
symbols—just project, damp, and measure.
